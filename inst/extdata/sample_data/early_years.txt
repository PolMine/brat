Little is known of O'Kelley's youth, although his birthplace is reported as Harrisonville, Missouri. His mother was Margaret Ann Capehart (6 July 1836 – 27 July 1903), but at the time of her 14 July 1857 marriage to Dr. Thomas Katlett O'Kelley (20 October 1833 – 9 October 1923) she was already pregnant with Edward. It is believed that Thomas was not Edward's father. Edward was a child during the American Civil War. In Thomas' Civil War Veteran Pension File, where Thomas was required to list all his children and their dates of birth, Edward is not included on the list.
