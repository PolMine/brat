## brat htmlwidget R package

This is a very first try to use the brat annotation tool for an htmlwidget for text annotation.

The file ./inst/htmlwidgets/brat/foo.html is a proof of concept that it would be possible to use brat. 
It is based on the instructions you find here: 
https://brat.nlplab.org/embed.html 

The StanfordCoreNLP Demo may serve as an inspiration codewise:

Open question: How do we / would we get text offset positions by mouseup event handler?
